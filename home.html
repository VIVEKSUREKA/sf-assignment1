                <h1>Hi, I am Vivek Sureka</h1>
                <p> I am a first year undergraduate student of IIT Kharagpur.
                    I am currently pursuing a degree in the branch  of Chemical Engineering.
                    <span id="know_more"><br>
                        Born and brought up in a relatively quiet neighbourhood in the city of Mumbai,
                        I have always surrounded myself and been mesmerised by fictional novels, 
                        my favourite genres being fantasy and mystery. Having lived a pretty 
                        conventional life so far, only recently have I picked up the colour 
                        palette and started re-painting my life, admittedly in a very whimsical manner.
